SUPER WELFARE EXPO 2020
(Exhibition organizing leader, Exhibition Music)

Like the ideals in your heart lead you to the outside world.
We see disabilities as "individuality" and deliver new values and ways of thinking through artwork. We also hope that this will lead to opportunities and confidence for all those who want to express themselves more.


「2020年、渋谷。超福祉の日常を体験しよう展」
(展示企画リーダー, 展示音楽)

心に秘めた理想(作品)が、外の世界(自分らしさ)へ導くように。⠀
障がいも”個性”と捉え、アート作品を通して、新たな価値観や考え方を届けます。そして、自分をもっと表現したい全ての人へ、そのきっかけや自信に繋がることを私達は願います。



Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
